# Pure CSS for Sass

`purecss-sass` is a Sass-powered version of [Pure](https://github.com/yahoo/pure/) CSS framework by Yahoo for your Ruby projects. It works with Ruby on Rails, Compass, Sprockets etc.

Original CSS files are converted using `sass-convert` and otherwise untouched and unmodified.

This project is heavily inspired from [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) by Twitter Bootstrap team.
